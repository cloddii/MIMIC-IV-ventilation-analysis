# Mechanical Ventilation Analysis in ICU Patients (MIMIC-IV)

## Project Overview
This project explores mechanical ventilation patterns and ICU outcomes
using publicly available ICU data from the MIMIC-IV database.

The focus is on data analysis and insight generation using Python and SQL.

## Objectives
- Analyze duration of mechanical ventilation
- Explore relationships with ICU length of stay and patient outcomes
- Demonstrate data analysis skills in a healthcare context

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQL
